# LightEffect

This program creates 2D light effects onto a pygame surface/image (32 bit PNG file encoded with
alpha channels transparency) and generate shadow.
The files radial4.png, RadialTrapezoid, RadialWarning are controlling the shape and light intensity
of the illuminated area (radial masks).

The class can be easily implemented into a 2D game (top down or horizontal/vertical scrolling) to enhanced
the lighting ambiance.

Version 2 changes :

 - Added volumetric effect (animated smoke or plasma) in the illuminated area to set a specific ambiance.
        This effect can also be used for generating force field around a set point.

 - Added warning light (rotational lighting)

 - Implemented shadow projection effects from a light source coordinates (See file Shadows.py for more details and
        credit to Marcus MÃ¸ller for its shadow algorithms (https://github.com/marcusmoller).

 - Code cleanup and split the code into different modules
    Constant.py
    LoadTextureFile.py
    Shadow.py
    LightDemo.py
